# README | CST-305: Project 1 - Visualize ODE With SciPy
> Preston Brownlee & Ryan White
---

*__Instructions:__ Identify a performance metric associated with a computer system that would necessitate the use of ODE to calculate. Your task is to develop the mathematical and computer programming solution to perform and visualize this calculation. The program processes an ODE as input from the user. Using the appropriate scientific computing package, write the appropriate code to solve the ODE. Based on the readings and class activities, choose the most appropriate visualization paradigm and style for the solution. When the program displays the solution, the language, terminology, units, and error estimates should be descriptive in the context of the problem you are solving. Write a computer program that solves an ODE and generates a visual representation of a solutions*

## Setup
This project was developed in thonny python3 with the installed numpy, SciPy, and Matplotlib packages.
This program will not function if your Python IDE cannot access numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib.

## Usage
Run the program in a python IDE and the shell will display instructions for user input. Any invalid input will not be accepted by the program and the user will be prompted to retry.

Once the user gives the appropriate input the program will create a chart to demonstrate the change in temperature in the conditions given by the user.
